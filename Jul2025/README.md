## Contest 1: Unstackable Sorting
Design a sorting system that can sort a variety of unstackable items in the next two weeks. You may work in teams of up to 5 members. The system should be able to handle at least 10 different types of unstackable items, fit within a specified size, and sort them efficiently.

### Requirements
1. **Item Types**: The system must handle at least 10 types: potions, books, music discs, flint and steel, shears, snow bucket, water bucket, lava bucket, boats, and minecarts.
2. **Size**: The system must fit within a volume of 4096 blocks.
3. **Speed**: The sorting process must be completed within 5 minutes for a box of items (27 items).

### Judging Criteria
1. **Functionality**: Does the system sort all ten item types correctly (+25 points)? More points for additional item types (+2 for each potion type, +5 for each cart variant, +5 for chest boat, +4 for each armor type, +4 for netherite tools, +1 for each music disc type). 
2. **Robustness**: How well does the system handle unexpected timings? (+15 points for random-input proofing)
3. **Size**: Does the system fit within the size constraints? (+25 points)? More points for smaller designs (+5 points if it fits within a volume of 2000 blocks OR +10 points if it fits within 1500 blocks OR +15 points if it fits within 1000 blocks OR +25 points if it fits within 500 blocks).
4. **Speed**: How fast is the sorting process? (+25 points for sorting within 5 minutes). More points for faster designs (+5 points for 1 item/32gt OR +10 points for 1 item/16gt OR +15 points for 1 item/8gt).
5. **Lag**: How much lag does the system cause? (+20 points for smallest active lag impact among contenders, +10 points for no static entities)
6. **Innovation**: Unique or creative design elements (subjective, up to +5 points for each unique feature)
7. **Quality**: Overall quality of the design, including aesthetics and ease of use (subjective, up to 10 points).

### Submission Guidelines
- Submit a schematic of the design with a description of what items it sorts, and what features it has to #contest-submissions . Note: what you submit for the contest will NOT be considered for archival by default.
- You must have made the bulk of the device during the contest. You can use existing components but submissions of full devices already published elsewhere may be heavily penalized.

### Prizes
- The winning team will be awarded a special role (unstackable champion) in the community and recognition for their achievement.
- 5 $10 steam gift cards will also be distributed as prizes. They will be awarded to the creators of design with the highest scores, and if there are leftover prizes, they will be awarded to the next highest scores. We encourage teamwork. A team of up to 5 members can submit a single design and receive a gift card each if they win.

### Judges
- @andrews54757 and @jaexyn . We will average scores from judges. Additional judges from experienced members may be announced as time goes.

### Important Dates
- **Start Date**: Jul 5 2025
- **Submission Deadline**: Jul 19 2025
- **Judging Period**: Jul 20 - Jul 26 2025
- **Winners Announced**: Before Jul 27 2025

### Notes
You may use allays or other sorting techniques, but be mindful of how points are given. You are not allowed to use the copper golem or any content from snapshots. If you find an issue with your submission, we will accept corrections after the deadline but make no guarantees that judges will update scores if it has already been graded.

## Clarifications
1. Armor types for extra points refer to the different slots you can put the armor in, not the material such as iron, diamond, etc...
2. All items must be survival obtainable in 1.21.4
3. We judge volume by taking the smallest cuboid bounding box of the submission and counting the number of blocks inside the area, including air blocks.
